## What is a Devsprint?
Devsprints are two days of intensive learning and development on an open source project of your choice, in a team environment. It's a time to come together with friends, old and new, to share what you've learned and apply it to an open source project.
Has contributing to Open source projects been one of those plans for you that just remained a plan? Or did you try contributing to an Open source project but got lost somewhere in the middle due to lack of guidance? Well, Devsprints are here to save the day! During Devsprints, Mentors/Contributors of Open source projects guide participants through everything, from generating the development build to submitting a patch for a bug or improve the project's documentation.
PyCon India  provides the space and infrastructure (network, power, tables & chairs); you bring your skills, humanity, and brainpower (oh! and don't forget your laptop).
## Who can participate?
***You!*** It doesn’t matter if you are a newbie or an experienced contributor, just dive in and get to work. Newbies sit with gurus, go out for lunch and dinner together, and have a great time while advancing their project. It is also a great opportunity to understand and experience the ways of the open source. Although, there will be situations when you might feel stuck, but there is nothing to worry about as the mentors present there can provide you instant help to get you moving. We can say this from experience, that participants of these Devsprints have not been limited to their open source contribution just for the conference days.They are still active contributors. You can purchase Devsprints ticket [here](https://in.pycon.org/2019/#tickets).
## Who can run a Devsprints?
***You!***   If you are a contributor or have been involved in the maintenance of any Open source project place, please come forward. You can submit your proposal for your Devsprints here. This project can be any interesting open source project which is based on Python. You should have enough contributions to the project. Your responsibility will be to help your team set up their development environment, list out beginner friendly bugs and guide them on any problems. Don't hesitate to submit your proposals. Any maintainer is welcome to add a project. PyCon India is open for everyone.
